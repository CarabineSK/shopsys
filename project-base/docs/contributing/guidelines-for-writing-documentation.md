# Guidelines for Writing Documentation

Documentation is distributed with the source code of Shopsys Framework inside [docs](../../docs/) directory in the project root.

## Rules for writing documentation
* documentation is written in [Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* all documentation files should be named same as first heading (in lowercase, non-alphanumeric characters replaced by dash)
* references to project files and classes should be local links - eg. `[app/config/config.yml](../../app/config/config.yml)`
