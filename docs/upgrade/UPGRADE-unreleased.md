### Application

    - replace usages of `OrderProduct`, `OrderPayment`, and `OrderTransport` with common `OrderItem`
        - use `isType<type>()` method instead of `instanceof`
    - replace usages of `OrderTransportData`, `OrderPaymentData` with common `OrderItemData`
    - replace usages of `OrderProductFactoryInterface`, `OrderPaymentFactoryInterface` and `OrderTransportFactoryInterface` with common `OrderItemFactoryInterface`
        - replace usages of `OrderProductFactory`, `OrderPaymentFactory` and `OrderTransportFactory` with `OrderItemFactory`
        - replace usages of method `create()` with `createProduct()`, `createPayment()` or `createTransport()`, respectively
    - replace usages of `OrderPaymentDataFactoryInterface` and `OrderTransportDataFactoryInterface` with common `OrderItemDataFactoryInterface`
        - replace usages of `OrderPaymentDataFactory` and `OrderTransportDataFactory` with common `OrderItemDataFactory`
        - replaces usages of method `createFromOrderPayment()` and `createFromOrderTransport()` with `createFromOrderItem()`
    - following classes changed constructors, if you extend them, change them appropriately:
        - `Order`
        - `OrderDataFactory`
        - `OrderItemFacade`
        - `OrderFacade`
    - remove non-existing test cases from `EntityExtensionTest`
        - remove `ExtendedOrder*` classes
        - remove calling `doTestExtendedEntityInstantiation` with classes that are removed
        - change `ExtendedOrderItem` to standard class - remove `abstract` and inheritance annotations
        - change `doTestExtendedOrderItemsPersistence` to test only `OrderItem`
